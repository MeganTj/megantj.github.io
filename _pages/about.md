Hi! I’m Megan, a first year PhD student in Computer Science at MIT CSAIL, co-advised by Professor Armando Solar-Lezama and Professor Wojciech Matusik. Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Caltech where I worked with Professor Yisong Yue. My research interests center at the intersection of deep learning, reasoning, interpretable machine learning, and program synthesis. I seek to design machine learning systems that are human-interpretable, robust, and highly generalizable to difficult tasks with limited data. 

I’m grateful to have been supported by the MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2022-2023 and to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).

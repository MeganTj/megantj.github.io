Hi! I’m a third year PhD student in Computer Science at MIT CSAIL, advised by Professor Armando Solar-Lezama. Previously, I completed my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Caltech where I worked with Professor Yisong Yue.

I’m grateful to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP) and the MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2022-2023.
